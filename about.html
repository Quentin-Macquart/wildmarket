    <p class = "about">The WildMarket is not just an online store. This is a site that allows us to bring together all Lille wilders through “reminder” type goodies.
What is important to us is to make sure that the wilders remember where they came from and to remember this great adventure through our shop.
Enjoy by browsing our site you will find various articles of the wild and do not hesitate to give your opinion</p>
